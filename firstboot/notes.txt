What is SpringBoot ?
> SpringBoot is a sub-part of spring framework. Which is a java based framework for building enterprise
  application. It supports building native, web and standalone application.
> For building Rest or Web application we can use SpringBoot.
> SpringBoot is powerful framework, as it is a Framework it has all the tools which is required in the world
  of web application.
> SpringBoot is popularly known for its dependency injection architecture.
> SpringBoot has its own object manager known as Inversion of Control (IoC) principle. Dependency injection (DI)
  is a specialized form of IoC, whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they
  work with) only through constructor arguments. The IoC container then injects those dependencies when it
  creates the bean.

What is Bean?
> In simple words Bean is nothing but simple object of any java class.
> As SpringBoot will have dependency manager it does not automatically create the object of all the classes
  inside your application. You have to mark a class with some annotation so that SpringBoot will create there
  objects and inject them to other classes if they need it.
> We can use @Component, @Service annotation for creating bean of our class.
> But if you have object of your class you can annotate that object with @Bean in that case also SpringBoot will
  save your object and inject it on time.
  @Bean
  	public MyFirstClass getFistClass() {
  		return new MyFirstClass();
  	}
> If you have multiple Beans we have to use @Qualify("BeanName") annotation and similarly on @Bean("BeanName").

What is Profile?
> Consider profile as different environment for SpringBoot application.
> We have special file called application.properties which can hold properties for your application like
  keys, constants or etc.
> We can create multiple application properties file like one file for dev application.properties.dev it will
  have some different keys and constant and production keys and constant will be inside application.properties.
> We have one annotation called @Profile("env_name"), We can set this on Beans in other words If you want to
  make some Bean only available on specific environments then use @Profile annotation and provide environment
  name. So SpringBoot will use those Beans only if that specific environment is active.
